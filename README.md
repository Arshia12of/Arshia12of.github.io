General description of the project:
The general services of the project include two parts. The first part is for guest users (users who have not logged in yet) and the second part is for users who have logged in and are looking for more services.

- The first part:
In this section, users can watch the slides related to food information and health points and select the food in the lower part and see its calories based on their desired weight.
The user can log in on the 'Navigation Bar' at the top of the page (if he has an account) and if the user does not have an account, they can use the "Create Account" button to enter the registration section, which is done in two steps. 
The first step is for user account information such as email, username and password. And the next step wants personal information such as height, weight, age, gender, and activity level of the person. At this step, if you enter your weight with many decimal places, it will be rounded to one-tenth of a decimal. Also, at the initial registration step, if your selected username is already available, it will warn you to change your username, and if the password and confirmation password are not the same at this step, it will warn you, again.

- The second part:
The focus of our site is based on a person's login because by logging in, the user can see the number of calories needed by their body in a day, which is calculated using the (Mifflin-St Jeor) equation, and it is one of the most reliable caloric calculation equations.
In the under of slides, the user can see the percentage of calories consumed from the total daily calories, as well as the remaining calories. Also, the user can select the foods (as described above), with the difference that if he consumes that food, it is reduced its calories from the remaining daily calories and they can see the rest of them.
/ In the login phase, if the username or password is incorrect, an error will be displayed. Users who are logged in can change their personal information or change their password in their profile, they can also log out or go to the history page where they can see the entire history of their food consumption. Also, by choosing a day, they can see all the foods consumed that day and the total calories consumed that day.
/ In all steps that are connected with the server and the user gives a value, if the connection with the server is interrupted, an error will be displayed asking you to try again.
/ In the search step, if the food is not selected on the selected date, the user will receive a message, which is *Date don't find!*. Also, if no date is selected and the "search" button is pressed, the message will be displayed, which is *Date is empty!*. By clicking the "all" button, all history will be displayed.
